    <h1>General Summary of Article</h1>
    <p id="something">&bull; The reduction in cardiovascular risk obsered in adults older than 45 years old, from
    Wegovy treatment was significant, when compared to the placebo treatment. A double blinded experiment
    means that neither the participants or the doctors know who is receiving what. In the month August when Wegovy
    was shown to reduce these ailments,  the stock price jumped 17% according to Yahoo Finance.</p>

    <p>&bull; The profit has increased almost <b>73%</b> over the past 5 years for Novo.
    With the creation of this new drug, Wegovy, in addition to their already very
    profitable diabetic treatments, a large percentage Denmark GDP will be on behalf of Novo
    . The next plot shows the percentage of Denmark GDP to Novo profit. There was only enough data
    to analyze 3 years.</p>

    <p>&bull; The percentage of GDP that Novo Nordisk profit consists of is similar from 2019-2021.
    This is not indicative of what the percentage would be close to now due to Covid-19 and increased
    profit figures on behalf of Novo. There just isn't enough GDP data yet to get up to 2022, 2023 years.
    Right around 12% is still ridiculously high though, even though the country is relatively small. This
    raises the question of whether the country is becoming too reliant on Novo financials.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>&bull; In conclusion, it is known that the distibution of this new drug will change not only the
    financial landscape of the company, but also the financial landscape of Denmark (where Novo is located).
    And these effects have already been witnessed with the stock closing prices.
